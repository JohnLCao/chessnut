===What are Chess variants?
Chess variants are mutations on the cannonical game of {Chess}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess]. Often Variants include
new pieces, time restrictions, move modifications, and more. Examples of Chess variants include Losing Chess, 4 player chess, and blitz Chess. 

===Chessnut 
{Chessnut}[https://chessnutio.herokuapp.com/#!/login] currently fully supports the classical variation of Chess, {Chess 960}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960], and {Blitz Chess}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess]. Chessnut partially supports {Crazyhouse}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazyhouse], and is looking to fully implement it together with other variations in the future.
