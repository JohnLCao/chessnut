===What are Chess variants?
Chess variants are mutations on the cannonical game of {Chess}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess]. Often Variants include
new pieces, time restrictions, move modifications, and more. Examples of Chess variants include Losing Chess, 4 player chess, and blitz Chess. 

===Chessnut 
{Chessnut}[https://chessnutio.herokuapp.com/#!/login] currently fully supports the classical variation of Chess, {Chess 960}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960], and {Blitz Chess}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess]. Chessnut partially supports {Crazyhouse}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazyhouse], and is looking to fully implement it together with other variations in the future. 
====Classical
The classical variation of Chess is known as the Royal Game and often seen as the ultimate intellectual sport. Classical Chess has been likened to art, science, and a good fight. 

The game offers vast possibilities over the board, and as seen champions with diverse styles. Chess is rightfully so described by Grand Master Walter Browne as a "natural cerebral high".
